# JSON lines

Add support for the "JSON lines" format. Here, we have one JSON value
per line. Here are the specs:

    This page describes the JSON Lines text format, also called newline-delimited JSON. JSON Lines is a convenient format for storing structured data that may be processed one record at a time. It works well with unix-style text processing tools and shell pipelines. It's a great format for log files. It's also a flexible format for passing messages between cooperating processes.

    The JSON Lines format has three requirements:
    1. UTF-8 Encoding

    JSON allows encoding Unicode strings with only ASCII escape sequences, however those escapes will be hard to read when viewed in a text editor. The author of the JSON Lines file may choose to escape characters to work with plain ASCII files.

    Encodings other than UTF-8 are very unlikely to be valid when decoded as UTF-8 so the chance of accidentally misinterpreting characters in JSON Lines files is low.

    Like the JSON standard a byte order mark (U+FEFF) must NOT be included.
    2. Each Line is a Valid JSON Value

    The most common values will be objects or arrays, but any JSON value is permitted. e.g. null is a valid value but a blank line is not.

    See json.org for a definition of JSON values.
    3. Line Terminator is '\n'

    This means '\r\n' is also supported because surrounding white space is implicitly ignored when parsing JSON values.

    Including a line terminator after the last JSON value in a file is strongly recommended but not required. Including a line terminator after every JSON value makes generating and concatenating JSON Lines files easier. If a line terminator follows the last JSON value in a file, it must be the last byte in the file.
    Conventions

    JSON Lines files may be saved with the file extension .jsonl.

    Stream compressors like gzip or bzip2 are recommended for saving space, resulting in .jsonl.gz or .jsonl.bz2 files.

    MIME type may be application/jsonl, but this is not yet standardized; any help writing the RFC would be greatly appreciated (see issue).

    Text editing programs call the first line of a text file "line 1". The first value in a JSON Lines file should also be called "value 1".
