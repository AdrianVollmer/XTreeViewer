# Configuration File

Add support for a configuration file to allow users to customize XTV behavior and appearance. Create a configuration file format (TOML or YAML) that supports settings like color theme (dark/light), tree view width percentage, detail view visibility, lazy loading threshold, streaming file size threshold, default expanded depth, and keyboard shortcuts. The config file should be loaded from `~/.config/xtv/config.toml` (or OS-appropriate location). Implement a default configuration with sensible values that is used when no config file exists. Add validation for config values and helpful error messages for invalid configurations. Consider adding a `--config` CLI flag to specify a custom config file path.
