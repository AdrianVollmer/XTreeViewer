# Streaming Support for Large Files

Add streaming reader support for very large files (>1GB) to enable XTV to handle massive data files without loading everything into memory. Implement streaming parsers that can progressively read and parse file content on-demand. This may require building an index file first for quick random access to different parts of the tree structure. The streaming implementation should detect when a file exceeds the size threshold (configurable, default ~1GB) and automatically switch to streaming mode. Display a progress indicator during index building. The user experience should remain smooth with lazy evaluation of tree nodes as they're navigated.
