# LDIF Parser

Implement a custom parser for LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files to enable viewing LDAP directory entries as tree structures. LDIF files can be very large (up to 20GB), so the parser should support efficient reading and potentially build an index for quick navigation. Each LDIF entry should be represented as a tree node with the DN (Distinguished Name) as the label. Attributes in LDIF can have multiple values, which should be stored as a list in the node's attribute collection. The parser should handle common LDIF features like base64-encoded values, change records, and comments. Follow the existing parser pattern and add comprehensive tests with sample LDIF files.
